Das coisas boas demais pra ser verdade: uma pessoa começou a dar comida para os corvos da vizinhança, e eles se tornaram “leais” à ela. O número de corvos cresceu e eles começaram a defender a casa da pessoa de “intrusos” (suas visitas). A história é genial:

> A couple months ago, i was watching a nature program on our local station about crows. The program mentioned that if you feed and befriend them, crows will bring you small gifts. My emo phase came back full force and i figured that i was furloughed and had lots of time- so why not make some crow friends.
>
> My plan worked a little too well and the resident 5 crows in my neighborhood have turned into an army 15 strong. At first my neighbors didnt mind and enjoyed it. They're mostly elderly and most were in a bird watching club anyway. They thought the fact that i had crows following me around whenever i go outside was funny.
>
> Lately, the crows have started defending me. My neighbor came over for a socially distanced chat (me on my porch her in my yard) and the crows started dive bombing her. They would not stop until she left my yard.

`/u/crane` [contou essa história](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/ki6fnd/oregon_i_accidentally_created_an_army_of_crow/) em um subreddit especializado em “aconselhamento jurídico”, questionando se ela seria responsabilizada caso os corvos atacassem alguém. O tópico é divertido por si só, e o conselho escolhido foi sobre como ensinar os corvos a se comportar:

> They are resource guarding. To stop them from attacking people, ask guests to bring shiny objects or food scraps to the murder of crows as an offering. You could also supply your guests little baggies of treats for them to offer up. If they dive bomb someone don’t give them food for 24 hours. If they are nice to a guest, give them a high value treat to reinforce positive behavior. Advice from my partner, she was a field biologist that is published in biology/ornithology.

O tópico fez tanto sucesso que `/u/crane` [postou uma atualização](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/duplicates/lobhtj/oregon_i_accidentally_created_an_army_of_crow/) sobre como os corvos acabaram salvando a vida de um de seus vizinhos:

> The plan worked and the crows are now a beloved part of the community. There have been no recent dive bombings.
> 
> Most amazingly, the crows may have legitimately saved my neighbor. Our city had a pretty big ice and snow event recently. Like i said in my last post, most of my neighbors are older. One of my neighbors was walking down his steep driveway, slipped, and couldnt get back up.
>
> The crows started going ballistic and were making more noise than we have ever heard. A different neighbor went outside to see what was up and found the gentleman in his driveway. Neighbor is mostly ok! Just some serious bruises.

De vez em quando a internet consegue ser boa demais.
